    DESCRIPTION_ConnectionTimeout: 'When syncing a large dataset to Typesense the connector can time out.  You can adjust this timeout limit as-needed.  The units are measure in seconds.'
    DESCRIPTION_DefaultSortingField: 'The name of an int32 / float field that determines the order in which the search results are ranked when a sort_by clause is not provided during searching. This field must indicate some kind of popularity. You cannot define a default sort on "auto" fields; it must be an explicitly defined field on your schema'

    DESCRIPTION_ImportLimit: 'This is the number of documents that can be uploaded into Typesense at once when the sync task is run.  This is usually adjusted for speed and memory reasons, for example if your collection is very large (2M records) or the indexing task is being run on a system with limited memory.'

    DESCRIPTION_TokenSeperators: 'List of symbols or special characters to be used for splitting the text into individual words in addition to space and new-line characters. For e.g. you can add - (hyphen) to this list to make a word like non-stick to be split on hyphen and indexed as two separate words. <a href="https://typesense.org/docs/guide/tips-for-searching-common-types-of-data.html" target="_new">More info</a>'
